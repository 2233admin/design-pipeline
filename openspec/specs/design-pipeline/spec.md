# design-pipeline Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Design-first scope

The pipeline SHALL optimize for design outcomes and SHALL NOT become a general-purpose skill marketplace.

#### Scenario: External engineering skill considered

- **WHEN** an external engineering skill is proposed
- **THEN** it SHALL be accepted only if it supports design implementation, validation, artifact lifecycle, or design QA.

### Requirement: OpenSpec-aligned artifact lifecycle

The pipeline SHALL use durable artifacts for each change and SHALL map them to OpenSpec proposal, design, tasks, and spec delta concepts.

#### Scenario: New design change starts

- **WHEN** a new design change starts
- **THEN** the pipeline SHALL create or use a change folder with brief, directions, design, motion, tasks, QA, state, events, and handoff artifacts.

### Requirement: Optional companion skill fallback

The pipeline SHALL not fail only because optional companion skills are missing.

#### Scenario: User has only design-pipeline installed

- **WHEN** self-check runs with only the core pipeline installed
- **THEN** required checks SHALL pass and missing optional skills SHALL report warnings with fallbacks.

### Requirement: Motion is first-class

The pipeline SHALL require explicit motion documentation for non-trivial animation and interaction motion.

#### Scenario: GSAP animation is planned

- **WHEN** GSAP, Anime.js, React View Transitions, scroll animation, route transition, or multi-step choreography is planned
- **THEN** the pipeline SHALL require `motion.md` using the motion spec template.

### Requirement: Headless agent handoff

The pipeline SHALL expose enough machine-readable state for another AI agent to resume without the original UI or conversation.

#### Scenario: Agent resumes a change

- **WHEN** another agent resumes a design-pipeline change
- **THEN** it SHALL read `state.json`, recent `events.jsonl`, and `handoff.md` before continuing.

### Requirement: Open-source readiness gate

The pipeline SHALL define release criteria for open-source publication.

#### Scenario: Maintainer prepares release

- **WHEN** a maintainer prepares to publish
- **THEN** all MUST checks in the open-source readiness reference SHALL pass or the release SHALL be marked not ready.
